# JNA
The Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) is a data collection excercise carried out by the GTRM Peru, R4V's National Platform, as part of the Refugees and Migrants Response Plan (RMRP) and Refugees and Migrants Needs Analysis (RMNA) preparation activities. 

For the RMRP 2025-26 update, R4V's Coordination Platform held an important standardization process to have a unique set of core questions to be implemented in the questionnaires by each National Platform. 

The final output of the Joint Needs Assessment is the calculation of the People in Need (PiN) per sector and Intersectoral, the summary measure. PiN's are a substantial part of the planning process for the RMRP since it serves as the ceiling for targets within each sector.

The GTRM Peru embraced this standardization process using the core questions and adding some of the extended version items. 
The sample was obtained from an artificial joint sampling frame that was built with registries from UNHCR's and IOM's internal registry systems (ProGres and Scope). In order to cope with data protection clearances, adhoc artificial ID's where assigned to the beneficiaries registered. 

For the data collection procees, two service providers where hired to do the phone surveys. The data collection process ocurred during April 3rd to 19th. 

The final dataset after quality checks and consistency procedures has information of 1,573 households and 5,827 people.
